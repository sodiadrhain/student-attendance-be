# Attendance Management System API (Backend)

An Attendance Management System is web-based software application designed and developed for recording, tracking and storing studentsâ€™ attendance in institutions. The proposed system uses a generated QR code which can be scanned with the mobile phone of students. This process does not require much action from the lecturer except displaying the generated QR code.
